NOVA: AI-Powered Career Intelligence
N.O.V.A – Navigate • Optimize • Validate • Achieve -
Your AI Career Intelligence Platform

I built N.O.V.A (Navigate • Optimize • Validate • Achieve) as a full-fledged AI-powered career intelligence platform designed to help professionals strategically advance their careers. The system begins by extracting data from resumes in various formats (PDF, DOC, TXT), using a combination of keyword extraction, contextual parsing, and experience-level estimation to analyze a user's background with precision. A proprietary match scoring algorithm then calculates how well the user aligns with different job roles and salary expectations. Using this data, NOVA generates a 3-phase personalized career roadmap — spanning foundation, development, and market positioning — complete with milestones, resource recommendations, deadlines, and projected success probabilities. I implemented a smart job-matching engine that provides the top three premium job listings tailored to the user’s profile, complete with realistic company details and role fit. Users can then export a professionally formatted, multi-page PDF report containing their analysis, insights, and roadmap, visually presented with score meters and branded aesthetics.

From a design perspective, I applied a highly polished UI/UX system using a professional black/yellow/white palette, animated gradient backgrounds, glassmorphism, and premium components like animated score meters and floating callouts. The frontend was built using React 18 with TypeScript, powered by Vite for blazing-fast builds, and styled with Tailwind CSS. The architecture follows a modular service-based structure, with dedicated services for AI analysis, job search, PDF export, and Telegram notifications. For user flow, I designed a complete journey from a compelling landing page to profile setup, live resume analysis, and a real-time results dashboard. I addressed various engineering challenges including API errors, resume parsing inconsistencies, and build optimization, while also ensuring complete mobile responsiveness and smooth animations. Hosted on Netlify, NOVA is production-ready, visually exceptional, and functionally robust — a true AI command center for career growth. Built by Chrissie Raj, it transforms uncertainty into actionable intelligence, helping users navigate, optimize, validate, and achieve their professional goals.
